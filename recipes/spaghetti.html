    <h2>How to Make Spaghetti Step-By-Step</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade spaghetti:</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty spaghetti has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This spaghetti recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>spaghetti noodles: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this spaghetti extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the spaghetti when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
